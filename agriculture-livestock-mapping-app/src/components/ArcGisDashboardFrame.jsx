/**
 * The embed.
 *
 * `src` is always a same-origin path produced by `embedUrl` — never a GeoHub
 * address. The applications are privately shared and the portal sends
 * X-Frame-Options, so a cross-origin frame could neither authenticate nor even
 * render; routing through this origin's proxy is what lets one sign-in cover
 * every map.
 *
 * `flex: 1 1 0` (in .app-frame) is what makes the frame take the leftover
 * height of the pane instead of its short intrinsic height.
